# Student-Portal

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED.

Making use of the Spring Tool Suite (STS) which is an Eclipse-based IDE(optimized for developing Spring framework-based projects) we built our project.
The data used was manually created using sql queries.
The entire API based project is built using Java 11.
We used Postman to test the APIs created.
For UI we used the Visual Studio code.

WHAT OUR PROJECT DOES.

This is a website created for a student to take his/her tests. 
They have to first login the page if they had already registered, or signup if they are new users. Once they are done with signing in, they will be directed to the page that consists of all the courses they can take a test in, select a subject and take test.
They will be directed to the tests page where they take the test and submit once the test is done. The result will be displayed immediately. They can log out after the score is displayed.
